# Python Practice – Control Flow

This repo contains Python exercises I’m doing to learn programming.

### Exercise 1: Even or Odd Number Printer
- Asks the user for a number.  
- If the number is negative, asks again until valid.  
- If the number is even, prints all even numbers from 0 up to that number.  
- If the number is odd, prints all odd numbers from 1 up to that number.
