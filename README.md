# Python Practice – Control Flow

This repo contains Python exercises I’m doing to learn programming.

### Exercise 1: Even or Odd Number Printer
- Asks the user for a number.  
- If the number is negative, asks again until valid.  
- If the number is even, prints all even numbers from 0 up to that number.  
- If the number is odd, prints all odd numbers from 1 up to that number.  

### Exercise 2: Grade Calculator
- Asks the user to enter their score (0–100).  
- If the score is invalid (less than 0 or more than 100), asks again.  
- If the score is 90 or above, prints **Grade A**.  
- If the score is 80–89, prints **Grade B**.  
- If the score is 70–79, prints **Grade C**.  
- If the score is 60–69, prints **Grade D**.  
- Anything below 60, prints **Grade F**.  

### Excercise 3: Classroom Attendance Checker

- Checks student attendance across multiple classes using nested lists and loops.
- Prints students starting with "A".
- Stops checking a class if "Eve" is found.
- Skips students starting with "G".
- Counts total students checked.
