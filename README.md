# Python Practice – Control Flow

This repo contains Python exercises I’m doing to learn programming.

### Exercise 1: Even or Odd Number Printer
- Asks the user for a number.  
- If the number is negative, asks again until valid.  
- If the number is even, prints all even numbers from 0 up to that number.  
- If the number is odd, prints all odd numbers from 1 up to that number.  

### Exercise 2: Grade Calculator
- Asks the user to enter their score (0–100).  
- If the score is invalid (less than 0 or more than 100), asks again.  
- If the score is 90 or above, prints **Grade A**.  
- If the score is 80–89, prints **Grade B**.  
- If the score is 70–79, prints **Grade C**.  
- If the score is 60–69, prints **Grade D**.  
- Anything below 60, prints **Grade F**.  

### Excercise 3: Classroom Attendance Checker

- Checks student attendance across multiple classes using nested lists and loops.
- Prints students starting with "A".
- Stops checking a class if "Eve" is found.
- Skips students starting with "G".
- Counts total students checked.


### Project practice : To-Do List
This is a simple Python console-based to-do list program I made while learning programming basics.  
It uses lists, loops, and conditional statements to manage tasks interactively.

## Features
- View all current tasks  
- Add new tasks  
- Remove tasks by name  
- Quit the program  

## How It Works
1. The program starts with an empty task list.  
2. You can add as many tasks as you want.  
3. Tasks can be removed by typing the exact name.  
4. The menu repeats until you choose **Quit**.  .
